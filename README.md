## Integration for Kinect on Apple Silicon

Macinect is a research project focused on developing integration support for Microsoft Kinect sensors on Apple systems running on Mx processors (Apple Silicon). This project aims to bridge the gap between Kinect's powerful sensing capabilities and the Apple ecosystem.

## Project Overview

Macinect explores methods to utilize Kinect sensors on macOS running on Apple Silicon. The project is currently investigating a virtualization approach while working toward native support in the future.

## Kinect Integration and Development

This section outlines the progress and current status of our efforts to integrate the Microsoft Kinect sensor into our project.

### Recent Updates (May 13, 2025)

* **Virtual Machine Migration:** We have transitioned our virtual machine environment from Parallels to UTM. This shift aligns with our preference for open-source solutions.
* **Windows Environment:** The UTM virtual machine is configured with Windows 7 and Python 3.7.
* **PyKinect Adaptation:** A modified version of the PyKinect library has been implemented to ensure compatibility with Python 3.x.
* **OSC Communication:** We are utilizing the `python-osc` library to facilitate the transmission of skeleton data from the virtual machine to the host MacBook Pro M4.
* **Driver Success:** The Kinect for Windows v1.8 drivers were successfully installed, and the Kinect sensor is correctly recognized within the Windows Device Manager without any errors.
* **Successful OSC Connection:** An Open Sound Control (OSC) connection has been successfully established between the virtual machine and the host macOS.
* **Kinect Recognition Issue (VM):** Despite the successful driver installation and OSC setup, our initial Python test script within the virtual machine failed to detect or locate the connected Kinect sensor.
* **Graphics Compatibility Challenges (VM):** Attempts to run Kinect Studio and TouchDesigner 0.99 within the UTM virtual machine were unsuccessful due to limitations with virtualized graphics drivers and adapters. This is a known limitation of many virtual machine environments.
* **NI Mate Instability (VM):** Efforts to use NI Mate for data acquisition and OSC transmission resulted in the application crashing after installation. This issue is also suspected to be related to graphics driver incompatibility within the virtual machine.
* **Current Focus: Native macOS Development:** Our primary focus has shifted towards developing a native macOS solution to eliminate the complexities and potential latency introduced by the virtual machine setup. This involves:
    * Integrating **Libfreenect** to directly interface with the Kinect sensor on macOS.
    * Implementing **computer vision techniques** to perform skeleton tracking directly on the raw depth image data.

This native approach aims to provide a more efficient and robust solution by running the entire process directly on the host MacBook Pro M4.

### Current Approach

- Running Kinect drivers through a Virtual Box VM
- Transmitting sensor data via OSC (Open Sound Control) protocol to the main macOS system
- Leveraging open-source technologies to maintain flexibility and community collaboration

### Future Goals

- Develop native support for Kinect on Apple Silicon
- Optimize performance for M-series processors
- Create an accessible API for macOS developers

## Development Status

## Macinect: Project Update 12-03-2025
Latest Developments for Kinect on Apple Silicon
Virtual Machine Approach Update
We're making progress on the Macinect project with a significant change to our virtualization strategy. Here's what's new:

Switched from VirtualBox to Parallels for virtualization due to its easier setup process and better compatibility with Apple Silicon
Currently testing with Windows 10 ARM version 1904 as the guest operating system
Exploring two methods for Kinect data transmission:

TouchDesigner implementation for visual processing and OSC transmission
Custom Python script alternative for direct OSC data streaming



Current Workflow
The current implementation follows this data path:

Kinect sensor connects to the Parallels VM running Windows 10 ARM
Data is processed within the VM using either TouchDesigner or our Python script
Processed data is transmitted via OSC protocol to the host macOS system
macOS applications can then utilize the Kinect data for various applications

Next Steps

Fine-tune the OSC data transmission for optimal performance
Compare latency between TouchDesigner and Python script approaches
Begin preliminary research on native driver possibilities for Apple Silicon
Document the Parallels setup process for other developers

Known Issues

Some latency in the virtualized environment
Occasional USB connection stability challenges
Limited access to advanced Kinect features through the current pipeline


This remains an active research project with ongoing development. Contributions and feedback welcome!
