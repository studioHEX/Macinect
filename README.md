## Integration for Kinect on Apple Silicon

Macinect is a research project focused on developing integration support for Microsoft Kinect sensors on Apple systems running on Mx processors (Apple Silicon). This project aims to bridge the gap between Kinect's powerful sensing capabilities and the Apple ecosystem.

## Project Overview

Macinect explores methods to utilize Kinect sensors on macOS running on Apple Silicon. The project is currently investigating a virtualization approach while working toward native support in the future.

### Current Approach

- Running Kinect drivers through a Virtual Box VM
- Transmitting sensor data via OSC (Open Sound Control) protocol to the main macOS system
- Leveraging open-source technologies to maintain flexibility and community collaboration

### Future Goals

- Develop native support for Kinect on Apple Silicon
- Optimize performance for M-series processors
- Create an accessible API for macOS developers

## Development Status

Macinect: Project Update
Latest Developments for Kinect on Apple Silicon
Virtual Machine Approach Update
We're making progress on the Macinect project with a significant change to our virtualization strategy. Here's what's new:

Switched from VirtualBox to Parallels for virtualization due to its easier setup process and better compatibility with Apple Silicon
Currently testing with Windows 10 ARM version 1904 as the guest operating system
Exploring two methods for Kinect data transmission:

TouchDesigner implementation for visual processing and OSC transmission
Custom Python script alternative for direct OSC data streaming



Current Workflow
The current implementation follows this data path:

Kinect sensor connects to the Parallels VM running Windows 10 ARM
Data is processed within the VM using either TouchDesigner or our Python script
Processed data is transmitted via OSC protocol to the host macOS system
macOS applications can then utilize the Kinect data for various applications

Next Steps

Fine-tune the OSC data transmission for optimal performance
Compare latency between TouchDesigner and Python script approaches
Begin preliminary research on native driver possibilities for Apple Silicon
Document the Parallels setup process for other developers

Known Issues

Some latency in the virtualized environment
Occasional USB connection stability challenges
Limited access to advanced Kinect features through the current pipeline


This remains an active research project with ongoing development. Contributions and feedback welcome!
