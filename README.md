## Integration for Kinect on Apple Silicon

Macinect is a research project focused on developing integration support for Microsoft Kinect sensors on Apple systems running on Mx processors (Apple Silicon). This project aims to bridge the gap between Kinect's powerful sensing capabilities and the Apple ecosystem.

## Project Overview

Macinect explores methods to utilize Kinect sensors on macOS running on Apple Silicon. The project is currently investigating a virtualization approach while working toward native support in the future.

### Current Approach

- Running Kinect drivers through a Virtual Box VM
- Transmitting sensor data via OSC (Open Sound Control) protocol to the main macOS system
- Leveraging open-source technologies to maintain flexibility and community collaboration

### Future Goals

- Develop native support for Kinect on Apple Silicon
- Optimize performance for M-series processors
- Create an accessible API for macOS developers

## Development Status

This project is currently in active research and development. The virtualization approach serves as a functional interim solution while native implementation research continues.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Kinect sensor (v1 or v2)
- Mac with Apple Silicon processor (M1, M2, etc.)
- Virtual Box or compatible virtualization software
- Compatible OS for VM (Linux recommended)

## Getting Started

*Documentation coming soon as development progresses*
